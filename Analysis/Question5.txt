###Set Quantiles
###Added Round to create Whole numbers since rankings were getting dropped

rankQuants <- round(quantile(df.MergedData$Ranking, probs = seq(0,1, by = .20)), digits = 0)


###Getting the length of the MergedData Set

Length <- 1:length(df.MergedData$GDP)


###Create the Cut Points for the rankings

cuts <- rankQuants

#Creates the labels for the Quantiles
labs <- c("<20%","21%-40%","41%-60%","61%-80%",">80%")

#Creates new Column in the MergedData Data Set using the Labels built previously
df.MergedData$Quants <- labs[findInterval(Length, cuts)]


###Create Question 5 data frame

df.Question5Analysis <- sqldf('select CountryCode, [Short.Name], Ranking, Quants, [income.Group] from [df.MergedData]')


###Create table of Income Group Vs Quantiles

Question5Table <- table(df.Question5Analysis$Income.Group,df.Question5Analysis$Quants )
